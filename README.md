# Covid-Analysis-Project-3
Visualizations using JavaScript libraries

**Project Contributors:**
Aisha Henderson, Rajeshwari Radhakrishna and Kelly Blake

The goal of this project was to create an interactive visualization that will allow end-users to view and explore COVID-19 data by country. We utilized the below-referenced datasets to understand the
differences and global impact of COVID-19 over time, looking at areas such as total cases, total deaths, total vaccinations and new/active cases.

**Datasets Utilized:**
Covid Cases by Country -2023
•Source: Kaggle
•About Dataset: Number of reported cases and deaths from the SARS-CoV-2 Virus for each
country. Data (to-date) as of 8/6/2023.

Daily Cases and Deaths by Date (1) // Vaccination Data (2)
Datasets Utilized:

**Project Parameters:**

1. Your visualization must include a Python Flask-powered API, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, and at least one     database (SQL, MongoDB, SQLite, etc.).

2. Your project should fall into one of the below four tracks:
  - A combination of web scraping and Leaflet or Plotly.
  - A dashboard with multiple charts that update from the same data.
  - A "thick" server that performs multiple manipulations on data in a database prior to visualization     (must be approved.
    
3. `Your project should include at least one JS library that we did not cover.

4.  Your project must be powered by a dataset with at least 100 records.

5.  Your project must include some level of user-driven interaction, such as menus, dropdowns, and         textboxes.

6.  If possible, your final visualization should include at least three views.
